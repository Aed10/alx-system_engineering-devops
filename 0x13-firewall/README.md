# 0x13-firewall

Certainly! The **0x13-firewall** project focuses on configuring and managing firewall settings using **ufw** (Uncomplicated Firewall). Specifically, it involves the following tasks:

1. **Blocking Incoming Traffic**: The project sets up rules to block incoming traffic, except for specific TCP ports.
2. **Port Forwarding**: It also configures port forwarding to redirect traffic from one port to another.

The project is implemented on **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS** and utilizes the **ufw** firewall software.
